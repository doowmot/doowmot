# üëã Hello there! I'm Tom.

(It's pronounced "Tom")

Junior software developer with a background in financial services, a fondness for clean code, and a talent for fixing things that weren't broken until I touched them.

Former mortgage advisor who went from explaining complicated things to confused humans to being the confused human getting explained things by error messages. Tis the circle of life.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I'm Currently Working On
- Building full-stack projects with JavaScript (MERN stack) while trying not to break the internet
- Applying for junior roles that value learning velocity, impact, and minimal meetings about meetings

## üß† Books That Shaped My Thinking
- [Poor Charlie's Almanack](https://www.google.com/search?q=poor+charlie%27s+almanack+book) (Charlie Munger)
- [Zero to One](https://www.google.com/search?q=zero+to+one+peter+thiel+book) (Peter Thiel)
- [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.google.com/search?q=fooled+by+randomness+nassim+taleb+book) (Nassim Taleb)

- [The School of Life: An Emotional Education](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+school+of+life+an+emotional+education+book) (Alain de Botton)

## üí≠ Current Interests
I'm fascinated by AI, the future of work, and how not to get replaced by either. I believe problem-solving skills transcend specific technologies, which is fortunate because I've chosen a career where everything I learn will be obsolete in five years.
