# 👋 Hello there! I'm Tom.

Junior software developer with a background in financial services, a fondness for clean code, and a talent for fixing things that weren't broken until I touched them.

Former mortgage advisor who went from explaining complicated things to confused humans to being the confused human getting explained things by error messages. Tis the circle of life.

## ✍️ Essays

I'm fascinated by AI, the future of work, and how not to get replaced by either. I believe problem-solving skills transcend specific technologies, which is fortunate, because I’ve chosen a career where everything I learn might be obsolete in five years.
