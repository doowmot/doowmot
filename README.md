# üëã Hello there! I'm Tom.
(It's pronounced "Tom")

Junior software developer with a background in financial services, a fondness for clean code, and a talent for fixing things that weren't broken until I touched them.

Former mortgage advisor who went from explaining complicated things to confused humans to being the confused human getting explained things by error messages. Tis the circle of life.

## üí≠ Current Interests

### AI and the Future of Work
I'm fascinated by AI, the future of work, and how not to get replaced by either. I believe problem-solving skills transcend specific technologies, which is fortunate because I've chosen a career where everything I learn will be obsolete in five years.
