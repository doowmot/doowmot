# 👋 Hello there! I'm Tom.

Junior software developer with a background in financial services, a fondness for clean code, and a talent for fixing things that weren't broken until I touched them.

Former mortgage advisor who went from explaining complicated things to confused humans to being the confused human getting explained things by error messages. Tis the circle of life.

## ✍️ Essays

I'm fascinated by AI, the future of work, and how not to get replaced by either. I believe problem-solving skills transcend specific technologies, which is fortunate, because I’ve chosen a career where everything I learn might be obsolete in five years.

These essays explore some of the big-picture thinking behind my transition into software development:

- [🧭 Career Strategy Doc – Behind-the-scenes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hi01kRs79aZP8ZkzUi_VJVG4L0HBHfZgvSvJGStpb98/edit?usp=sharing)  
  A transparent look at how I’m approaching my career change — goals, risks, timelines, mental models, and how I’m trying to optimize for long-term learning and leverage.

- [📘 Coding in the AI Age](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jqmoxbzrKSAWJupv9jY1yvDVaN5jnBEXSvrVrwJVV6I/edit?usp=sharing)  
  A real-time existential crisis about whether software developers are the new factory workers — and what it means to run *towards* AI instead of away from it.
