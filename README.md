# 👋 Hello there! I'm Tom.

tom@doowmot.com | [doowmot.com](https://www.doowmot.com) | [CV](https://doowmot.com/cv.pdf) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doowmot)

Junior software developer with a background in financial services, a fondness for clean code, and a talent for fixing things that weren't broken until I touched them. Former mortgage advisor who went from explaining complicated things to confused humans to being the confused human getting explained things by error messages. Tis the circle of life.

## ✍️ Essays

I'm fascinated by AI, the future of work, and how not to get replaced by either. I believe problem-solving skills transcend specific technologies, which is fortunate, because I’ve chosen a career where everything I learn might be obsolete in five years.
